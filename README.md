# Undergraduate_projects
These projects are for my undergraduate days, they may not be coded in a clean way, and sometimes there are no comments, or if there are comments, they are not regular, in some programs, commenting has been done as a matter of principle, It also goes back to my early days learning a programming language. I hope those who have suitable projects can use them.

Some programs may even be limited to printing a simple string (toy examples), but I also wrote many good and challenging projects that you can see in the desired directories separately for each lesson, which you will probably find useful.
These were my programming experiences from the beginning to the end of my undergraduate course. Of course, I have many more experiences besides these programs, but these are the projects that I handed over to professors when I was a student.

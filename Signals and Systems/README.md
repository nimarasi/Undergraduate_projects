# Signals and Systems

## Project 1 
 - Fourier Series (signal reconstruction) : <br>
   Write program that reconstructs Xn signal for different N and compare result with main signal.(N=5,10,100) <br>
   let: ùúè = 2 , ùëÅ0 = 5

## Project 2
  - Converting a noisy signal to a noise-free signal (Filter noisy signal): <br>
    The main signal is a clean signal without noise. You remove the noise from the noisy signal and draw the result with the main signal, compare to see how much noise is removed and how much the main signal is            damaged.

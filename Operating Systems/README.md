# Operating Systems

  ## Chapter 3 (Processor timing)
   - Write a program that first, read the number of processes from the input, then read the computational burst times and input times in milliseconds, and calculate        the average waiting and return time using the methods **FCFS**(FIRST-COME, FIRST-SERVED), **SJF**(Shortest Job First), **SRTF**(shortest remaining time first),        **RR**(Round-robin scheduling).(Get the time quantum for the RR method from the user)

  ## Chapter 5 (Deadlock management)
   - Implement the banker's algorithm. First, get the number of processes and resources from the user.Then read the values ​​of *Allocation*, *Max*, *Available* arrays.      <br>
        A) Check if the system is in safe mode? <br>
        B) Get a request from the user for a process and check if this request can be given?

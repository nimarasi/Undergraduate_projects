# Algorithm design

## Chapter 1 (Preliminary methods of algorithm design)
  - 1- Write a program that reads n numbers and puts them in an array. Then using the method Divide and Conquer, with the least number of comparisons between n               numbers, find the smallest and largest of them and print.
  - 2- Write a program that reads n numbers and puts them in an array. Then use Divide and conquer method to find the largest element of n array.
## Chapter 2 (Dynamic programming method)
  - 1- Write a program that takes the adjacency matrix of a weighted and directed graph with n vertices (W matrix) and using Floyd's algorithm, calculate and print           the length of the shortest path between all vertices(matrix D) [ more details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd-Warshall_algorithm ]
  - 2- Write a program that takes n dimensions of the matrix (array d) and using dynamic programming, get the optimal order of multiplication and print it.
## Chapter 3 (Greedy method)
  - 1- Write a program that takes the deadline and profit of n jobs from the input and using the scheduling algorithm with a given deadline, determine the optimal            schedule and the total profit and print it
